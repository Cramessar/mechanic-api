# File: tests/__init__.py

"""

Useful to test utilities or structure tests modularly.
For now, it’s just here to make Python happy — also whoever happens to be grading this assignment.

Use the command below in powershell to run all tests in this folder:
*_ python -m unittest discover tests  _*

After running test make sure to rerun the app.py to restore the database to its original state.
